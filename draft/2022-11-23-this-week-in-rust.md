### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A fairly quiet week with regressions unfortunately slightly outweighing improvements. There was not any particular change of much note. Many of the regressions were justifiable since they were for critical bug fixes.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [96ddd32c..a78c9bee](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=96ddd32c4bfb1d78f0cd03eb068b1710a8cebeef&end=a78c9bee4d9d51a3891bd8ecae1f28a93b83653b&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

**Summary**:

| (instructions:u)                   | mean  | range          | count |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:-----:|
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (primary)    | 0.7%  | [0.2%, 3.0%]   | 76    |
| Regressions ❌ <br /> (secondary)  | 1.5%  | [0.3%, 8.4%]   | 69    |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (primary)   | -0.7% | [-1.8%, -0.2%] | 18    |
| Improvements ✅ <br /> (secondary) | -1.4% | [-3.2%, -0.2%] | 35    |
| All ❌✅ (primary)                 | 0.4%  | [-1.8%, 3.0%]  | 94    |


7 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 6 Mixed; 5 of them in rollups
47 artifact comparisons made in total

### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

Every week, [the team](https://www.rust-lang.org/team.html) announces the 'final comment period' for RFCs and key PRs
which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.

#### [RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/labels/final-comment-period)

# Quote of the Week

> While working on these userspace Mesa changes today, I did not hit a single GPU kernel driver bug. Not. A. Single. Bug.
>
> This is thanks to Lina's phenomenal efforts. She took a gamble writing the kernel driver in Rust, knowing it would take longer to get to the first triangle but believing it would make for a more robust driver in the end. She was right.
